\Large SYSTEMIC -- Transforming Big Data into New Worlds

\vspace{-2mm}
The ongoing discovery of thousands of planets beyond the Solar System is revolutionizing our understanding of the demographics of our Galaxy and is resonating intensely with the public. We propose to build a software ecosystem that will maintain and further galvanize the surge of public interest in extrasolar planets, while simultaneously providing critical, cutting-edge analysis tools for astronomers. Development of the type we are proposing has traditionally gone unsupported, but it is increasingly at the core of the scientific discovery process. Our ambitious program will provide value at all levels, from advanced scientific research to classroom teaching to general public outreach.  \textbf{The DDD initiative provides a unprecedented opportunity for funding the development of the risk-taking, innovative software tools and outreach programs detailed in this application.}  

\propsec{\Systemic{}: advanced analysis of time series}
We now know that the Galaxy teems with potentially habitable planets, and we are poised to discover examples orbiting the very nearest stars.  Our team at UC Santa Cruz and UT Austin is at the forefront of this quest, first with the Lick-Carnegie survey (at Keck, AAT and other facilities) and now with the new APF telescope. APF is a fully automated, high-throughput observatory. It  was purpose-built to find the nearest potentially habitable planets, and it is demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. Our team deploys this telescope on more than 150 nights per year.

The crucial analysis tool for the flood of data generated by our intensive search for planets is the  \Systemic{} software package, developed for the interpretation of exoplanetary time series. Since the code base is fully \textit{open source}, the scientific return on our time investment is far greater than an internal instrument pipeline. The entire community is free to adapt and integrate \Systemic{}. To date, the package has been used to discover or characterize more than 40 planetary systems, and users worldwide have registered to download it more than 5,000 times.

In parallel, \Systemic{} has evolved to become the cornerstone of an outreach and citizen science program through our release of simplified, online versions of the package. The public interface allows enthusiasts with no prior science background to productively visualize and analyze exoplanetary data. As a result, a large fraction of registered users are not professional astronomers; users include students, teachers and enthusiasts with no academic affiliation.

The \Systemic{} software package has already proven to be a successful tool for both outreach and scientific discovery, and it is available \textit{now} (\url{http://www.stefanom.org/systemic}).

\propsec{Plans}
In spite of the excellent research enabled by \Systemic{}, time spent writing freely available software and outreach tools is traditionally viewed as \textit{sunk} cost by funding organizations. The American Astronomical Society recognized this problem in a recent meeting, noting ``\textit{widely used software has enabled at least as much science as a new instrument would}'', but ``\textit{nothing within the funding agencies offer support for software development}''\footnote{\url{http://aas.org/posts/story/2014/01/astrophysics-code-sharing-ii-sequel}}. With this proposal, we envision two parallel scientific projects: (\textbf{1}) expansion and refinement of the \Systemic{} code to facilitate intuitive, state-of-the-art time series analysis, and (\textbf{2}) the development of a web-based interface to a massive set of data sources, with an accompanying online analysis tool based on \Systemic{}.

{\bf Project (1) aims to further generalize the \Systemic{} core and user interface to deal with disparate time series datasets from multiple scientific fields.} One of the key advantages of \Systemic{} is its intuitive user interface, which enables non-programmers to quickly prototype accurate and sophisticated analyses of  their data. At present, however, the tools are not as streamlined when importing data sources outside the ``default''  (radial velocity and timing data). This is an important disadvantage in the current astronomical landscape, in which time series from disparate sources are used to self-consistently characterize star/planet system models. Furthermore, large-scale surveys (such as LSST) will generate vast data volumes that require first-class analysis and cross-correlation with existing observations on short timescales. These \textit{big data} products will be measured in petabytes. As a consequence there will be urgent need for code that can be run locally \textit{and} on dedicated facilities close to the datacenters. \Systemic{} is uniquely positioned to become a dominant tool, as its architecture is modular, portable and tuned for performance\footnote{Link to whitepaper?}. %Surveys such as LSST will produce large volumes of data output, which will need to be analyzed with first-class tools in order to maximize the science-to-data ratio.

Project (2) addresses the current lack of an organic, comprehensive repository of astronomical time series. Although some projects have attempted to address this, the results have not always been usable by the scientific community at large. The astronomical community would profoundly benefit from an intuitive front-end interface offering uniform access to a queryable database, aggregating a large number of individual data providers. Indeed, several of our intended datasets for aggregation, including exoplanetary radial velocities, currently have no public repository.  The ``killer feature'' of Project (2) would be the integration of \Systemic{} into a top-to-bottom workflow. The query interface would be able to gather and filter relevant time series data from disparate data sources; subsequently, they could feed the data into an online version of \Systemic{} for further analysis. \textbf{Our vision for Project (2) will have a number of immediate benefits for users: (i) a uniform data analysis tool immediately available close to the data itself, (ii) wholly shareable workflow with the community, from the raw data to the final, reproducible scientific product, and (ii) widespread adoption of ``battle-tested'' data analysis flows and algorithms.}

We will lead development of both projects in open-source fashion, ensuring that anyone will be able to contribute to the codebase, add new features or data providers, or even fork code for their own needs. In parallel, we will continue our tradition of strong focus on the development of outreach and citizen science tools. \textbf{We have a proven track record in remixing and simplifying our advanced software into compelling apps that are appealing to the general public, while holding to a high standard of scientific accuracy.}  We plan to augment further our arsenal of visualization tools by capitalizing on the recent renaissance of Web technologies. Modern browsers enable immersive, interactive 3D visualizations on the Web, instrumental in attracting public interest. Simultaneously, our rigorous yet intuitive tools will appeal to science enthusiasts and enable new citizen science projects.

\propsec{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item A better title would be great. I also like the idea of having a bolded sentence driving home the point in each section.
\item \sout{We should list a few key ``buzzwords'' that should be hit (if not in the abstract, somewhere within the body of the application). E.g.: big data (heh), ...}
\item \sout{Actually count the planetary systems that were d/c with Systemic}
\item \sout{Add some passing reference to Meschiari et al., 2011 (discovery w/ citizen enthusiast)} \rarr{} in the ``relevant works'' section of bibliography
\item \sout{I would like to do a quantitative comparison between the reach within the literature of a popular code and Systemic. E.g. between '09 and '13, 5864 papers containing the keywords exoplanet/extrasolar planet were published; 55 cited Systemic. Is this a comparable reach to, say, Gadget2, once you normalize for all papers about Dark matter simulations/Galaxy formation/LSS formation/etc.?} \rarr{} in white paper
\item \sout{If we use LSST as a potential use case, then have an order-of-magnitude estimate of the amount of data produced (petabytes?). Also mention that LSST will have community access \& computing resources dedicated to the community access.}
\item Any nod to Kepler?
\item Change unusual to ``so unlike our own''
\end{itemize}
