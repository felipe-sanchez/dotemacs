A list of recommended starting points for developing a web app. It's written by an astronomer, so take them with a grain of salt.

* Presentational
** HTML & CSS
- Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) is a great reference. The same link also features guides for CSS and Javascript, and guides on how to use the Developer Tools in each browser.

- Dive into HTML5 (http://diveintohtml5.info) is an online e-book on HTML5 specifically (good if you already know the basics of HTML).

** Frameworks
- Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com) is one of the most common frameworks out there. It will give you a nice basis for designing your application and making sure it resizes and looks (more or less) the same on each browser/platform. It also provides a default theme that gives your page a professional look. (See e.g. http://www.stefanom.org/playpen/Trends/keywords/).

- UIKit (http://getuikit.com) is similar and also a great to get started.

- I used to use JQuery UI (https://jqueryui.com) instead of Bootstrap in the past. It's also a good place to get started, although it only provides you with components (I find Bootstrap to be a more complete solution for the kind of stuff I develop).

* Interactivity
** JavaScript
- The book "JavaScript: the good parts" by Douglas Crockford is a great, succinct book. 

- MDN is again a great reference.

- JQuery (http://jquery.com) makes the interaction with the webpage elements (the DOM) a lot less verbose and fraught with pitfalls. If you ever look at the source code for webpage scripts, that weird "$" symbol usually stands for the JQuery library namespace.

- Underscore.js (http://underscorejs.org) is a set of utility functions, great for working on lists and arrays. I also found it great for managing asynchronous functions.

- 

* Misc
- Writing code in a good editor makes all the difference: I can recommend Emacs (for a lightweight editor with a lot of shortcuts) or NetBeans (a full-featured IDE). Lots of other tools floating around the web.

- If you get into a "I don't know what the heck is going on" situation, Stack Overflow (http://stackoverflow.com) probably has the answer.
