BAM is a lightweight, elementary, extensible templating language based on Lua. It attempts to automate the writing of repetitive parts of a scientific papers, or parts that need to be updated frequently with the arrival of new data or better algorithms.
Our group at UC Santa Cruz also used it to one-click automate the writing of scientific papers about new exoplanets for many different datasets. One paper written entirely using a BAM template is downloadable here. (The referee enjoyed it.)
